At a basic level, that&#x27;s all there is to it.</p><p>And there&#x27;s more than that.</p><p>Website Designs are complex systems that help to keep YOUR BRAND in the mind of your customers. The best designs do typically use living and breathing design systems to keep YOUR BRAND consistent and noticeable everywhere your company shows up.</p><p>So that when a person sees your Ad, they see your colors, your font, etc. and remember that &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s THAT company that I keep seeing over &amp; over in my news feed until I decide to click on it and buy their awesome product&quot;. The more your brand gets noticed, the easier it is for them to get acquainted with it, that way, when these humans are FINALLY in a stage of life where they&#x27;re ready &amp; able take an action, they can 🙂.</p><p>So yes, good design is both complex &amp; simple, and it really takes a person with &quot;an eye for good design&quot; to know good from bad.</p><p>Typically the design process includes:</p><ul><li>Doing research about the company for which the design is being made (by filling out the form we on the next page 🙂)</li><li>Choosing Color Pallets and fonts for your brand</li><li>Creating Copywriting and setting up a Selling Content Structure on the said website</li><li>Making sure that all of the important information shows up and is prominent to the users of the website, and the less important information is either less noticeable or removed.</li><li>Making reusable components that are consistent across the website. This helps save TIME &amp; MONEY in the long run because it makes the website as a whole easier for developers &amp; designers to make changes to and work with, and minimizes errors in this process.</li></ul><p>Technically, Anyone can design a website. It&#x27;s not hard to download a popular website design software (like Figma or Balsamiq Mockups), copy someone else&#x27;s landing page, copy some styles, slap in a few buttons, switch a few colors, and call it a website design, but we&#x27;d advise thinking about it in the ways mentioned above.</p><p>Good design requires thought. Deep thought and someone with experience with design &amp; website design principles.</p><p>ZackHub has those designers 🙂. While this package is also included in our Website Build service, it can be valuable on it&#x27;s own if used by your own team of developers, or if you&#x27;d just like an effective prototype or preview of what your website could look like and how it&#x27;d be used before investing in the full build.</p><p>We&#x27;re here to help at every step of the way.</p><p>Ready to get started?</p><p>Click the Big Button below, fill out the form that follows in as much detail as you can, and we&#x27;ll get back to you as soon as possible.</p><p>We&#x27;re eagerly awaiting your responses 🙂.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Zack Plauché, CEO &amp; Founder of ZackHub (The Web Development Agency that cares about Design)</p>", "price": "80.00", "pricing_model": "Hourly", "cta": "Order Now", "cta_url": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDOfAunZ5YIwuboxC5U1hfrwPCKtwKNVdD95DLsmG43XWE5w/viewform?usp=sf_link", "pre_cta": "Learn More", "related_service": null, "redirect_url": null}}, {"model": "services.service", "pk": 9, "fields": {"icon": 13, "description": "<p> Django is a powerful open source Python Web Framework that allows developers to quickly build websites that are Fast, Flexible, and Robust, and can be customized to the needs of pretty much any project!</p><p>It&#x27;s an extremely valuable tool that our company uses quite frequently.</p><p>Combined with some of the external Web Frameworks like Bootstrap, django-wagtail, and more, you can build websites that are much easier to use than Wordpress for most clients, so they can focus on the content, and you can focus on the design and coding.</p><p>If you&#x27;re ready to learn more about Django, you&#x27;ve come to the right place 😁</p><p>Click the button below to Schedule a Call to learn Django yourself or allow us to train your company&#x27;s developers. </p>", "price": "80.00", "pricing_model": "Hourly", "cta": "Order Now", "cta_url": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTnz5wx2C8L1qgNtkhrQtRBR70_uQ1Q576H703X9Rf8SaITw/viewform?usp=sf_link", "pre_cta": "Learn More", "related_service": null, "redirect_url": null}}, {"model": "services.service", "pk": 11, "fields": {"icon": 9, "description": "<p>Django is a powerful open source Python Web Framework that allows developers to quickly build websites that are Fast, Flexible, and Robust, and can be customized to the needs of pretty much any project!</p><p>It&#x27;s an extremely valuable tool that our company uses quite frequently.</p><p>Combined with some of the external Web Frameworks like Bootstrap, django-wagtail, and more, you can build websites that are much easier to use than Wordpress for most clients, so they can focus on the content, and you can focus on the design and coding.</p><p>If you&#x27;re ready to learn more about Django, you&#x27;ve come to the right place 😁</p><p>Click the button below to Schedule a Call to learn Django yourself or allow us to train your company&#x27;s developers.</p>", "price": "80.00", "pricing_model": "Hourly", "cta": "Order Now", "cta_url": "https://calendly.com/zackhub/django-coaching-call", "pre_cta": "Learn More", "related_service": null, "redirect_url": null}}, {"model": "base.siteinfosettings", "pk": 2, "fields": {"site": ["www.zackhub.com", 80], "phone_number": "", "email": "", "facebook_url": "https://www.facebook.com/zackhubdotcom", "github_url": "", "instagram_url": "", "linkedin_url": "", "twitter_url": "", "youtube_url": ""}}, {"model": "base.homepage", "pk": 3, "fields": {"hero_title": "", "hero_subtitle": "", "hero_cta_url": 3, "hero_background_image": null, "body": "[{\"type\": \"section\", \"value\": {\"section_id\": \"about\", \"background_image\": null, \"css_classes\": \"text-center py-5\", \"custom_css\": \"\", \"container\": true, \"content\": [{\"type\": \"heading\", \"value\": \"Who We Are\", \"id\": \"e55e4500-6e45-4710-a76e-757accf3b14f\"}, {\"type\": \"lead_text\", \"value\": \"<span class=\\\"text-secondary\\\">ZackHub</span> is a Web Development Agency.

At a basic level, that&#x27;s all there is to it.</p><p>And there&#x27;s more than that.</p><p>Website Designs are complex systems that help to keep YOUR BRAND in the mind of your customers. The best designs do typically use living and breathing design systems to keep YOUR BRAND consistent and noticeable everywhere your company shows up.</p><p>So that when a person sees your Ad, they see your colors, your font, etc. and remember that &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s THAT company that I keep seeing over &amp; over in my news feed until I decide to click on it and buy their awesome product&quot;. The more your brand gets noticed, the easier it is for them to get acquainted with it, that way, when these humans are FINALLY in a stage of life where they&#x27;re ready &amp; able take an action, they can \\ud83d\\ude42.</p><p>So yes, good design is both complex &amp; simple, and it really takes a person with &quot;an eye for good design&quot; to know good from bad.</p><p>Typically the design process includes:</p><ul><li>Doing research about the company for which the design is being made (by filling out the form we on the next page \\ud83d\\ude42)</li><li>Choosing Color Pallets and fonts for your brand</li><li>Creating Copywriting and setting up a Selling Content Structure on the said website</li><li>Making sure that all of the important information shows up and is prominent to the users of the website, and the less important information is either less noticeable or removed.</li><li>Making reusable components that are consistent across the website. This helps save TIME &amp; MONEY in the long run because it makes the website as a whole easier for developers &amp; designers to make changes to and work with, and minimizes errors in this process.</li></ul><p>Technically, Anyone can design a website. It&#x27;s not hard to download a popular website design software (like Figma or Balsamiq Mockups), copy someone else&#x27;s landing page, copy some styles, slap in a few buttons, switch a few colors, and call it a website design, but we&#x27;d advise thinking about it in the ways mentioned above.</p><p>Good design requires thought. Deep thought and someone with experience with design &amp; website design principles.</p><p>ZackHub has those designers \\ud83d\\ude42. While this package is also included in our Website Build service, it can be valuable on it&#x27;s own if used by your own team of developers, or if you&#x27;d just like an effective prototype or preview of what your website could look like and how it&#x27;d be used before investing in the full build.</p><p>We&#x27;re here to help at every step of the way.</p><p>Ready to get started?</p><p>Click the Big Button below, fill out the form that follows in as much detail as you can, and we&#x27;ll get back to you as soon as possible.</p><p>We&#x27;re eagerly awaiting your responses \\ud83d\\ude42.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Zack Plauch\\u00e9, CEO &amp; Founder of ZackHub (The Web Development Agency that cares about Design)</p>\", \"price\": \"0.00\", \"pricing_model\": \"Hourly\", \"cta\": \"Order Now\", \"cta_url\": \"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDOfAunZ5YIwuboxC5U1hfrwPCKtwKNVdD95DLsmG43XWE5w/viewform?usp=sf_link\", \"pre_cta\": \"Learn More\", \"related_service\": null, \"redirect_url\": null}", "approved_go_live_at": null}}, {"model": "wagtailcore.pagerevision", "pk": 19, "fields": {"page": 7, "submitted_for_moderation": false, "created_at": "2021-04-09T19:32:10.169Z", "user": ["zackplauche@gmail.com"], "content_json": "{\"pk\": 7, \"path\": \"00010001000100010002\", \"depth\": 5, \"numchild\": 0, \"translation_key\": \"7c3ae05c-9c19-449e-9a79-23a16f53a82f\", \"locale\": 1, \"title\": \"Website Maintenance\", \"draft_title\": \"Website Maintenance\", \"slug\": \"website-maintenance\", \"content_type\": 9, \"live\": true, \"has_unpublished_changes\": false, \"url_path\": \"/home/services/website-services/website-maintenance/\", \"owner\": 1, \"seo_title\": \"\", \"show_in_menus\": false, \"search_description\": \"\", \"go_live_at\": null, \"expire_at\": null, \"expired\": false, \"locked\": false, \"locked_at\": null, \"locked_by\": null, \"first_published_at\": \"2021-04-09T14:54:47.968Z\", \"last_published_at\": \"2021-04-09T14:54:47.968Z\", \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2021-04-09T14:54:47.943Z\", \"live_revision\": 9, \"alias_of\": null, \"icon\": 4, \"description\": \"<p> Why should you build a website for your own company? </p><p>A few things come to mind at first:</p><ul><li><b>Security.</b> Not SOLELY relying on Social Media platforms that could accidentally delete your Ad Account or Page at any time.
