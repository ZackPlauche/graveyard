                        <p>Hey Henry! <br><br> I hope you're doing well. <br><br> I decided it'd make sense to make you a gift in the best way to know how: With code. Ok, this is only part of the gift, but if you have a useful idea for a project, I've decided to give you the gift below <a href="#gift-card">vvv</a></p>

                    <p><strong><i class="fancy">Congratulations!</i></strong></p>
                    <p>You've received your first <b>Zack Project Token</b>, good for redemption on any project ideas that likely will require some type of automation (though the delivery may take a while depending on the project).</p>
                    <p>In order to activate, we'll need to hop on a Zoom call for any specifics as well as write an email describing the project for MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVIT-EH!</p>
                    <p><small><strong>Note:</strong> I may record what myself building it to explain the process with my students.</small></p>
                    <p><small><strong>Note 2:</strong> You can optionally also get some lessons in coding if you'd like.</small></p>
                    <a target="_blank" href="mailto:zackplauche@gmail.com" class="btn btn-gift">Redeem Here</a>
                    <p><small><strong>(Hint: Send me an email or message whenever you're ready or know what you want, or call me at +1 303-261-8653)</strong></small></p>
                </div>

                <p>You actually had 2 of these, but one of them was kind of half-built (the project for automating your camera thing that we'd still need to hop on a call for, at least for setup), and would require to know more information about your exact screen size and would require a tech support call.</p>

                <p>I hope you enjoyed your website gift.</p>
                <p>Me, Olga, and Kot are going to send you a happy birthday video in Facebook (if we haven't already), so be ready for that.</p>
