# Zack Plauché Project Graveyard 🪦⛈️☔
Big repo full of old projects that weren't used very much or weren't very popular.
Consolidated to not be forgotten while not actually being used 🙂


**NOTE:** GitHub CLI with authorized credentials required to do actions.
Also, if you get a notification about credentials write the following in commandline to reset the token:
```cmd
set GITHUB_TOKEN=
```
